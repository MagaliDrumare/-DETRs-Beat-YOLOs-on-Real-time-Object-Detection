# DETRs-Beat-YOLOs-on-Real-time-Object-Detection

### We propose a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR, aka RTDETR), 
The first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge. Our RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 53.1% / 54.3% AP on COCO and 108 / 74 FPS on T4 GPU, outperforming previously advanced YOLOs in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, RT-DETR-R50 outperforms DINO-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and about 21 times in FPS. After pre-training with Objects365, RT-DETR-R50 / R101 achieves 55.3% / 56.2% AP.
